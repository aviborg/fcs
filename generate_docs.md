Excellent. Since you’ll be running the export locally in MATLAB, here’s a streamlined plan to **automatically upload the results to ChatGPT** and receive the documentation generated for DO-178C/DO-331.

## ✅ Upload Companion Script Options

There are **two ways** to automate the upload from your machine to ChatGPT:

---

### 🔁 **Option 1: Manual Upload**

After running the `generate_exports.m` script:

1. Zip the `exports/` folder:

```bash
zip -r exports.zip exports/
```

2. Upload `exports.zip` directly into this chat.

I'll then:

* Parse the structure
* Generate documentation artifacts (RTM, SVR, SECI, SAS, etc.)
* Return a new `.zip` with PDFs or DOCX files

---

### 🤖 **Option 2: Scripted Upload Using Python + OpenAI API**

If you want full automation (from Simulink to document generation), here’s a **Python script** using the OpenAI API to:

* Upload exported files
* Call GPT to process each artifact
* Save the generated documents

```python
import openai
import zipfile
import os

openai.api_key = "your-api-key"  # Set your OpenAI API key here

# Step 1: Compress export folder
zip_file_path = "exports.zip"
with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, "w") as zipf:
    for folder_name, _, filenames in os.walk("exports"):
        for filename in filenames:
            file_path = os.path.join(folder_name, filename)
            arcname = os.path.relpath(file_path, "exports")
            zipf.write(file_path, arcname)

# Step 2: Upload to OpenAI (placeholder for ChatGPT function)
with open(zip_file_path, "rb") as f:
    file_response = openai.files.create(file=f, purpose="assistants")

print("Uploaded file ID:", file_response.id)

# Step 3: Create a request to ChatGPT with processing instructions (example only)
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "This is a DO-178C Simulink export. Generate RTM, SVR, SECI, SAS from the uploaded zip."}
    ],
    tools=[{"type": "file", "id": file_response.id}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message["content"])
```

> **🛠 Note:** You’ll need a local Python environment, the `openai` package installed (`pip install openai`), and an API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/).

## 🔚 Summary

| Workflow         | Manual Upload | Python Script         |
| ---------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| 🔧 Setup         | Minimal       | Requires Python + API |
| 🔁 Repeatability | Manual        | Fully automatable     |
| 📤 Upload        | ChatGPT UI    | Programmatic          |

Would you like me to bundle the Python upload script into the zip or help you deploy it as a reusable tool for your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitLab/GitHub)?
