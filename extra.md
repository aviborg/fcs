## 🔍 Key Areas to Review and Prepare (Beyond What You've Done)

### 1. ✅ **Gap Analysis Against DO-178C Objectives**

Have you shown compliance with all objectives applicable to **Level B**?

| Annex | Focus                    | Status to Confirm                          |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| A–3   | Planning Process         | ✔️ PSAC, SDP, SVP, SCMP, SQAP              |
| A–4   | Development Process      | ✔️ Requirements, Architecture, Design      |
| A–5   | Integral Processes       | 🚧 Review independence? Anomaly logs?      |
| A–6   | Verification             | ✔️ SVCP, test procedures, MC/DC            |
| A–7   | Test Results             | ✔️ Reports, pass/fail, structural coverage |
| A–8   | Configuration Management | ✔️ Git logs, SECI, SCI                     |
| A–9   | Quality Assurance        | ✔️ Reviews, checklists, audits             |
| A–10  | Tool Qualification       | ✔️ GCC + AI-assisted qualification plan    |

➡️ **Suggestion**: Build a simple DO-178C compliance matrix that maps your artifacts to each objective.

### 2. 📁 **Organize a Certification Data Package**

Your DER (or internal QA team) will want a clean certification package:

```plaintext
cert_package/
├── planning/
│   ├── PSAC.pdf
│   ├── SDP.pdf
│   └── ...
├── development/
│   ├── SRS.md
│   ├── SAD.md
│   └── FDD.png
├── verification/
│   ├── RTM.html
│   ├── Verification_Report.html
│   └── Coverage_Summary.pdf
├── configuration/
│   ├── SECI.md
│   └── GitLogs/
├── tool_qualification/
│   ├── TQP.md
│   └── TVR.md
```

➡️ You can script this into a CI pipeline job that zips and stores the bundle on tag `release/SECI_vX.Y`.

---

### 3. 📦 **Independent Reviews and Change Control**

DO-178C requires:

* **Requirements and design reviews** (with traceable comments)
* **Verification reviews**
* **Change review boards** for deviation or issue tracking

➡️ Use GitHub issues + PRs + review checklists for traceability.

---

### 4. 🛡️ **Robustness and Boundary Testing**

These are often overlooked. DO-178C wants:

* Handling of invalid inputs
* Timing tests under stress
* Exception cases (NaN, infinity, etc.)

➡️ Ensure test cases for edge conditions are included and documented.

---

### 5. 🔐 **Security Awareness (non-DO-178C but critical)**

While not required under DO-178C, **cybersecurity** is now in scope for many cert projects via:

* **DO-326A** (Airworthiness Security)
* **ED-203A** (Software Assurance in the Face of Malicious Threats)

➡️ It’s wise to document:

* Assumptions about trusted inputs
* Any mitigations or defenses

---

## 🧠 Final Suggestion: Certification Readiness Review (CRR)

Before presenting to a DER or audit team:

* Perform a **self-review or AI-assisted audit** of your compliance artifacts
* Check for missing links, unresolved TBDs, untested requirements, etc.
* Run your final CI/CD job to regenerate all evidence from source
